# TeampotDaily

The objective of this application is to coordinate and carry out a dynamic, efficient, and fun daily meeting, in which the next team member to speak is randomly selected. Additionally, it includes the additional functionality of allowing the person with the most time to lead the next meeting.

This project was inspired by dailytoast.io, and arose from the need to implement a mechanism for assigning the next person to speak in a dynamic and entertaining way. The intention was to avoid the monotony of ceremonies and make them more exciting for all participants.

With this in mind, I dedicated my free time to developing a tool and presented it to the Santander Technology team. The tool was well received by my team and was then presented to the entire Santander organization. Currently, the tool is used daily by more than 15 teams, which is a great achievement.

Main features:
Incorporation of the team's name list (persisted via localStorage)
Random speaker selection.
Selection of the next speaker if needed.
Incorporation of more team members during the Daily if needed.
Skipping a team member if necessary.
Selection of the established time for each speaker.
Time counting for each speaker.
Text-to-speech announcing the speaker.
Animations and color changes based on elapsed time.
List of final times.
3 modes of selecting the next facilitator: longest time, random, do not select.
